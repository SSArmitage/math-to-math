#  :pencil2::notebook: Math-to-Math  :notebook::pencil2:
Have you ever written an equation down on paper and then needed to do something with that equation? For example, compare its accuracy, get information about the equation, compute a soltuion, or send it to someone else? Currently, with Math-to-Math you can say an equation aloud and it will provide you with the text-based output. Stretch goals: taking the text output and converting it appropriately (i.e. convert to computable symbols to find a solution).
